Template project for a bot discord based on typescript and discordjs library.

The `.env.production` file is there to put your bot's data only on your server. Never push this data on your repository.
You need to create a `.env.developement` file with the same variables as in the `.env.production` file.


Use `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` to launch the project
